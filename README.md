Project Title
Scheels "FizzBuzz" Website

Description:
This website was created for the Scheels ECOM Developer interview. It implements an FizzBuzz-style program that allows users to define a custom minimum and maximum number range, add, edit, or remove rules based on a divisor and output text, run the program to display results, and reset the output as needed.

Features
    -Dynamic number range configuration
    -Fully customizable rules (divisor + output text)
    -Live rule editing without deletion/re-creation
    -Clear separation of UI sections for readability

Possible room for improvement:
    -Eventually convert it to Node.js
        -Node.js was not necesarry with the current scope of the project.
        -Could be useful if we wanted to incorporate database interaction or server-side processing.
    -Add more input validation.
    -UI improvements
        -Increase polish and visual refinement
